# MyModule
Software to simulate a collection of stars near the Andromeda galaxy.

## Intent
Generate a catalogue of sources (stars) such that:
- Stars should have randomised sky positions around the Andromeda galaxy
- Positions should fall within 1 degree of the central location
- Each star should have a unique ID
- The star ID and position should be saved in a csv file to be analysed by other programs

## Installing
Use `pip install git+<link>`, or download and run `pip install .`

## Usage
`sky_sim` or `runme` are the two command line entry points.
They have no parameters or options that can be set.
